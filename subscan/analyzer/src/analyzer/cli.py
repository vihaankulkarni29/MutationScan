"""
Command-line interface for SubScan Analyzer

This module provides the command-line interface for the SubScan Analyzer engine,
which performs mutation detection and analysis on aligned sequence data.

The analyzer processes alignment files to identify mutations, variants, and
anomalies compared to wild-type reference sequences.
